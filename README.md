# Feature-Engineering

## Description
 In this ipynb notebook I work with the employee attrition data set. This data set contains a total of 35 features and 1470 rows. So, I combine some columns like "EnvironmentSatisfaction", "RelationshipSatisfaction" and "WorkLifeBalance" and create a new feature called "employee_satisfaction", this is basically a mean of those three columns. Like this, I create some more new features called Job_Satisfaction, freshers, etc.
